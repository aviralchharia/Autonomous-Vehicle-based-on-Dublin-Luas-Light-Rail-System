# Autonomous Vehicle based on Dublin's Luas Light Rail System

The aim of this project is to develop an autonomous vehicle using Arduino (Atmega-328p) & remote wireless supervisory control (using, XCTU & XBee or C#) with capability of ultrasonic obstacle detection & avoidance, self-parking, stopping at gantries in its path & safely co-existing with other vehicles. The Infra-Red module, Transmitter & Receiver circuits were designed & fabricated on a PCB from scratch to develop the vehicle.
